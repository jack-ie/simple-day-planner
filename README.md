## Usage
User enters tasks, appointments, and notes at an hourly basis to help keep track of their day.
* Time blocks are color coded for ease of use. Light gray is past time, white is current time, and beige is future time.
* Notes are saved locally and reappear the following day until "Clear Previous Day" is clicked.

 ## Future Development
 #### Other features that need to be added are save to phone calendar, store previous days and not loose your info, and full month calendar option.
